//! A pooled writer and compressor.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! `pooled-writer` solves the problem of compressing and writing data to a set of writers using
//! multiple threads, where the number of writers and threads cannot easily be equal.  For example
//! writing to hundreds of gzipped files using 16 threads, or writing to a four gzipped files
//! using 32 threads.
//!
//! To accomplish this, a pool is configured and writers are exchanged for [`PooledWriter`]s
//! that can be used in place of the original writers.  This is accomplished using the
//! [`PoolBuilder`] which is the preferred way to configure and create a pool.  The [`Pool`] and
//! builder require two generic types: the `W` Writer type and the `C` compressor type. `W` may
//! usually be elided if calls to [`PoolBuilder::exchange`] may be used to infer the type. `C`
//! must be specified as something that implements [`Compressor`].
//!
//! The [`Pool`] consists of two thread pools, one for compressing and one for writing. All
//! concurrency is managed via message passing over channels.
//!
//! Every time the internal buffer of a [`PooledWriter`] reaches capacity (defined by
//! [`Compressor::BLOCK_SIZE`]) it sends two messages:
//! 1. It sends a message over the corresponding writer's channel to the writer pool, enqueueing
//!    a one-shot receiver channel in the writers queue that will receive the compressed bytes
//!    once the compressor is done. This is done to maintain the output order.
//! 2. It sends a message to the compressor pool that contains a buffer of bytes to compress
//!    as well as the sender side of the one-shot channel to send the compressed bytes on.
//!
//! The writer thread pool contains a `Vec` of receivers, one for each writer. It loops over
//! this `Vec`, checking to see if the receiver has any messages. If it does, a lock is
//! acquired and that writer's receiver is drained, writing to the underlying writer that was exchanged
//! for the [`PooledWriter`].
//!
//! The compressor thread pool consists of a single receiver that is continually polled for new
//! messages. The messages are processed, the bytes compressed, and then the compressed bytes are
//! sent over the one-shot channel to the corresponding receiver, which is a place-holder receiver
//! in the writer queues.
//!
//! Shutdown of the entire pool is managed via a sentinel value that is checked in the writer loop.
//! If a shutdown has been requested a cascade of channel drops will cleanly disconnect all senders
//! and receivers and any further calls to [`PooledWriter`]s will result in an error.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::{
//!     error::Error,
//!     fs::File,
//!     io::{BufWriter, Write},
//!     path::Path,
//! };

//!
//! fn create_writer<P: AsRef<Path>>(name: P) -> Result<BufWriter<File>, DynError> {
//!     Ok(BufWriter::new(File::create(name)?))
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), DynError> {
//!     let writers = vec![
//!         create_writer("/tmp/test1.txt.gz")?,
//!         create_writer("/tmp/test2.txt.gz")?,
//!         create_writer("/tmp/test3.txt.gz")?,
//!     ];
//!
//!     let mut builder = PoolBuilder::<_, BgzfCompressor>::new(20, 8)
//!         .compression_level(5)?;
//!
//!    let mut pooled_writers = writers.into_iter().map(|w| builder.exchange(w)).collect::<Vec<_>>();
//!    let mut pool = builder.build()?;
//!
//!     writeln!(&mut pooled_writers[1], "This is writer2")?;
//!     writeln!(&mut pooled_writers[0], "This is writer1")?;
//!     writeln!(&mut pooled_writers[2], "This is writer3")?;
//!     pooled_writers.into_iter().try_for_each(|w| w.close())?;
//!     pool.stop_pool()?;

//!     Ok(())
